# Microsoft.PowerPlatform.UIAutomation
### Overview 
**Microsoft.PowerPlatform.UIAutomation** is a UI automation tool used for the Power Platform Admin Center.

### How Microsoft.PowerPlatform.UIAutomation works
**Microsoft.PowerPlatform.UIAutomation** is a UI automation project based on the Selenium UI Test Framework. The solution contains three projects, two of which are used as dependent assemblies for the unit test project.

The unit test project is designed to work within the Power Platform Admin Center to perform administrative tasks not currently automatable via APIs. The approach used here is not supported and is only needed as a stop gap until a proper API call is public.
